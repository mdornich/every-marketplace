## [2.18.0] - 2025-12-25

### Added

- **`agent-native-architecture` skill** - Added **Dynamic Capability Discovery** pattern and **Architecture Review Checklist**:

  **New Patterns in mcp-tool-design.md:**
  - **Dynamic Capability Discovery** - For external APIs (HealthKit, HomeKit, GraphQL), build a discovery tool (`list_*`) that returns available capabilities at runtime, plus a generic access tool that takes strings (not enums). The API validates, not your code. This means agents can use new API capabilities without code changes.
  - **CRUD Completeness** - Every entity the agent can create must also be readable, updatable, and deletable. Incomplete CRUD = broken action parity.

  **New in SKILL.md:**
  - **Architecture Review Checklist** - Pushes reviewer findings earlier into the design phase. Covers tool design (dynamic vs static, CRUD completeness), action parity (capability map, edit/delete), UI integration (agent → UI communication), and context injection.
  - **Option 11: API Integration** - New intake option for connecting to external APIs like HealthKit, HomeKit, GraphQL
  - **New anti-patterns:** Static Tool Mapping (building individual tools for each API endpoint), Incomplete CRUD (create-only tools)
  - **Tool Design Criteria** section added to success criteria checklist

  **New in shared-workspace-architecture.md:**
  - **iCloud File Storage for Multi-Device Sync** - Use iCloud Documents for your shared workspace to get free, automatic multi-device sync without building a sync layer. Includes implementation pattern, conflict handling, entitlements, and when NOT to use it.

### Philosophy

This update codifies a key insight for **agent-native apps**: when integrating with external APIs where the agent should have the same access as the user, use **Dynamic Capability Discovery** instead of static tool mapping. Instead of building `read_steps`, `read_heart_rate`, `read_sleep`... build `list_health_types` + `read_health_data(dataType: string)`. The agent discovers what's available, the API validates the type.

Note: This pattern is specifically for agent-native apps following the "whatever the user can do, the agent can do" philosophy. For constrained agents with intentionally limited capabilities, static tool mapping may be appropriate.

## [2.17.0] - 2025-12-25

### Enhanced

- **`agent-native-architecture` skill** - Major expansion based on real-world learnings from building the Every Reader iOS app. Added 5 new reference documents and expanded existing ones:

  **New References:**
  - **dynamic-context-injection.md** - How to inject runtime app state into agent system prompts. Covers context injection patterns, what context to inject (resources, activity, capabilities, vocabulary), implementation patterns for Swift/iOS and TypeScript, and context freshness.
  - **action-parity-discipline.md** - Workflow for ensuring agents can do everything users can do. Includes capability mapping templates, parity audit process, PR checklists, tool design for parity, and context parity guidelines.
  - **shared-workspace-architecture.md** - Patterns for agents and users working in the same data space. Covers directory structure, file tools, UI integration (file watching, shared stores), agent-user collaboration patterns, and security considerations.
  - **agent-native-testing.md** - Testing patterns for agent-native apps. Includes "Can Agent Do It?" tests, the Surprise Test, automated parity testing, integration testing, and CI/CD integration.
  - **mobile-patterns.md** - Mobile-specific patterns for iOS/Android. Covers background execution (checkpoint/resume), permission handling, cost-aware design (model tiers, token budgets, network awareness), offline handling, and battery awareness.

  **Updated References:**
  - **architecture-patterns.md** - Added 3 new patterns: Unified Agent Architecture (one orchestrator, many agent types), Agent-to-UI Communication (shared data store, file watching, event bus), and Model Tier Selection (fast/balanced/powerful).

  **Updated Skill Root:**
  - **SKILL.md** - Expanded intake menu (now 10 options including context injection, action parity, shared workspace, testing, mobile patterns). Added 5 new agent-native anti-patterns (Context Starvation, Orphan Features, Sandbox Isolation, Silent Actions, Capability Hiding). Expanded success criteria with agent-native and mobile-specific checklists.

- **`agent-native-reviewer` agent** - Significantly enhanced with comprehensive review process covering all new patterns. Now checks for action parity, context parity, shared workspace, tool design (primitives vs workflows), dynamic context injection, and mobile-specific concerns. Includes detailed anti-patterns, output format template, quick checks ("Write to Location" test, Surprise test), and mobile-specific verification.

### Philosophy

These updates operationalize a key insight from building agent-native mobile apps: **"The agent should be able to do anything the user can do, through tools that mirror UI capabilities, with full context about the app state."** The failure case that prompted these changes: an agent asked "what reading feed?" when a user said "write something in my reading feed"—because it had no `publish_to_feed` tool and no context about what "feed" meant.

## [2.16.0] - 2025-12-21

### Enhanced

- **`dhh-rails-style` skill** - Massively expanded reference documentation incorporating patterns from Marc Köhlbrugge's Unofficial 37signals Coding Style Guide:
  - **controllers.md** - Added authorization patterns, rate limiting, Sec-Fetch-Site CSRF protection, request context concerns
  - **models.md** - Added validation philosophy, let it crash philosophy (bang methods), default values with lambdas, Rails 7.1+ patterns (normalizes, delegated types, store accessor), concern guidelines with touch chains
  - **frontend.md** - Added Turbo morphing best practices, Turbo frames patterns, 6 new Stimulus controllers (auto-submit, dialog, local-time, etc.), Stimulus best practices, view helpers, caching with personalization, broadcasting patterns
  - **architecture.md** - Added path-based multi-tenancy, database patterns (UUIDs, state as records, hard deletes, counter caches), background job patterns (transaction safety, error handling, batch processing), email patterns, security patterns (XSS, SSRF, CSP), Active Storage patterns
  - **gems.md** - Added expanded what-they-avoid section (service objects, form objects, decorators, CSS preprocessors, React/Vue), testing philosophy with Minitest/fixtures patterns

- **`dhh-ruby-style` skill** - Expanded patterns.md with:
  - Development philosophy (ship/validate/refine, fix root causes, vanilla Rails first)
  - Rails 7.1+ idioms (params.expect, StringInquirer, positive naming conventions)
  - Extraction guidelines (rule of three, start in controller extract when complex)

### Credits

- Reference patterns derived from [Marc Köhlbrugge's Unofficial 37signals Coding Style Guide](https://github.com/marckohlbrugge/unofficial-37signals-coding-style-guide)

## [2.15.2] - 2025-12-21

### Fixed

- **All skills** - Fixed spec compliance issues across 13 skills:
  - Reference files now use proper markdown links (`[file.md](./references/file.md)`) instead of backtick text
  - Descriptions now use third person ("This skill should be used when...") per skill-creator spec
  - Affected skills: agent-native-architecture, andrew-kane-gem-writer, compound-docs, create-agent-skills, dhh-rails-style, dhh-ruby-style, dspy-ruby, every-style-editor, file-todos, frontend-design, gemini-imagegen

### Added

- **CLAUDE.md** - Added Skill Compliance Checklist with validation commands for ensuring new skills meet spec requirements

## [2.15.1] - 2025-12-18

### Changed

- **`/workflows:review` command** - Section 7 now detects project type (Web, iOS, or Hybrid) and offers appropriate testing. Web projects get `/playwright-test`, iOS projects get `/xcode-test`, hybrid projects can run both.

## [2.15.0] - 2025-12-18

### Added

- **`/xcode-test` command** - Build and test iOS apps on simulator using XcodeBuildMCP. Discovers projects/schemes, builds for simulator, installs and launches apps, takes screenshots, captures console logs, and supports human verification for Sign in with Apple, push notifications, and in-app purchases. Checks for XcodeBuildMCP installation first.

## [2.14.0] - 2025-12-18

### Added

- **`/playwright-test` command** - Run end-to-end browser tests on pages affected by a PR or branch. Uses Playwright MCP to navigate pages, capture snapshots, check console errors, test interactions, and pause for human verification on OAuth/email/payment flows. Creates P1 todos for failures and retries until passing.

### Changed

- **`/workflows:review` command** - Added optional Playwright testing phase (Section 7). After review agents complete, offers to spawn `/playwright-test` as a subagent to verify affected pages in a real browser.

## [2.13.0] - 2025-12-15

### Added

- **`dhh-rails-style` skill** - Write Ruby and Rails code in DHH's distinctive 37signals style. Router-pattern skill with sectioned references for controllers, models, frontend, architecture, and gems. Embodies REST purity, fat models, thin controllers, Current attributes, Hotwire patterns, and the "clarity over cleverness" philosophy. Based on analysis of Fizzy (Campfire) codebase.

## [2.12.0] - 2025-12-15

### Added

- **`data-migration-expert` agent** - New review agent for validating database migrations and data backfills. Ensures ID mappings match production reality, checks for swapped values, verifies rollback safety, and provides SQL verification snippets. Prevents silent data corruption from mismatched enum/ID mappings.
- **`deployment-verification-agent` agent** - New review agent that produces Go/No-Go deployment checklists for risky data changes. Creates pre/post-deploy SQL verification queries, defines data invariants, documents rollback procedures, and plans post-deploy monitoring.

### Changed

- **`/workflows:review` command** - Added conditional agents section. Now automatically runs `data-migration-expert` and `deployment-verification-agent` when PR contains database migrations (`db/migrate/*.rb`), data backfills, or ID/enum mapping changes.

## [2.11.0] - 2025-12-10

### Changed

- **Command naming convention** - Workflow commands now use `workflows:` prefix to avoid collisions with built-in Claude Code commands:
  - `/workflows:plan` (was `/plan`)
  - `/workflows:review` (was `/review`)
  - `/workflows:work` (was `/work`)
  - `/workflows:compound` (was `/compound`)

  This ensures no collision with Claude Code's built-in `/plan` command.

### Fixed

- **`heal-skill.md`** - Added missing `name:` frontmatter field
- **`create-agent-skill.md`** - Added missing `name:` frontmatter field
- **`prime.md`** - Rewrote corrupted command file (was incorrectly containing CLAUDE.md content)
- **Playwright MCP alias** - Shortened from `playwright` to `pw` to stay under 64-char API limit

### Removed

- **`prime.md`** - Removed from plugin (personal setup command, not for distribution)
- **`codify.md`** - Removed deprecated command (replaced by `/compound`)

## [2.10.0] - 2025-12-10

### Added

- **`agent-native-reviewer` agent** - New review agent that verifies features are agent-native. Checks that any action a user can take, an agent can also take (Action Parity), and anything a user can see, an agent can see (Context Parity). Enforces the principle: "Whatever the user can do, the agent can do."
- **`agent-native-architecture` skill** - Build AI agents using prompt-native architecture where features are defined in prompts, not code. Includes patterns for MCP tool design, system prompts, self-modification, and refactoring to prompt-native.

### Changed

- **`/review` command** - Added `agent-native-reviewer` to the parallel review agents. Code reviews now automatically check if new features are accessible to agents.

### Fixed

- **Documentation** - Fixed mermaid diagram legibility in dark mode by changing stroke color to white (PR #45 by @rickmanelius)

## [2.9.4] - 2025-12-08

### Changed

- **`/work` command** - Improved screenshot documentation for PR creation. Made capturing screenshots REQUIRED for any UI changes. Updated to use `imgup` skill with `pixhost` as default host (no API key needed). Clarified what to capture: new screens, before/after for modifications, and Figma design matches.

## [2.9.3] - 2025-12-05

### Changed

- **`/plan` command** - Added "Open plan in editor" as the first option in post-generation menu. This opens the plan file in the user's default editor for review before deciding on next steps.

## [2.9.2] - 2025-12-04

### Added

- **`/work` command** - Added screenshot documentation step for UI changes. Before creating PRs, use Playwright to capture before/after screenshots, upload via 0x0.st (using imgup skill), and include in PR description.

## [2.9.1] - 2025-12-04

### Changed

- **`/plan` command** - Reordered post-generation options: Review first, Work locally second, Work on remote third (using `&` for background execution). Removed "Rework" as separate option since "Other" handles custom changes.

## [2.9.0] - 2025-12-02

### Changed

- **Plugin renamed** from `compounding-engineering` to `compound-engineering`. Shorter name, same philosophy. Users will need to reinstall with the new name.

### Fixed

- **Documentation counts** - Updated all documentation to reflect actual component counts (24 agents, 19 commands).

## [2.8.3] - 2025-11-29

### Fixed

- **`gemini-imagegen` skill** - Added critical documentation about file format handling. Gemini returns JPEG by default, so using `.jpg` extension is required to avoid "Image does not match media type" API errors. Added examples for PNG conversion when needed and format verification.

## [2.8.2] - 2025-11-28

### Changed

- **`gemini-imagegen` skill** - Updated to use only Pro model (`gemini-2.0-flash-preview-image-generation`) by default. Removed regular Nano Banana model reference. Added explicit options for aspect ratio (1:1 to 21:9) and resolution (1K default, 2K, 4K). Simplified documentation with clear defaults.

## [2.8.1] - 2025-11-27

### Added

- **`/plan` command** - Added "Create Issue" option to post-generation menu. Detects project tracker (GitHub or Linear) from user's CLAUDE.md (`project_tracker: github` or `project_tracker: linear`) and creates issues using `gh issue create` or Linear CLI.

## [2.8.0] - 2025-11-27

### Added

- **`julik-frontend-races-reviewer` agent** - New review agent specializing in JavaScript and Stimulus code race conditions. Reviews frontend code with Julik's eye for timing issues, DOM event handling, promise management, setTimeout/setInterval cleanup, CSS animations, and concurrent operation tracking. Includes patterns for Hotwire/Turbo compatibility and state machine recommendations.

## [2.7.0] - 2025-11-27

### Changed

- **`/codify` → `/compound`** - Renamed the documentation command to better reflect the compounding engineering philosophy. Each documented solution compounds your team's knowledge. The old `/codify` command still works but shows a deprecation notice and calls `/compound`.
- **`codify-docs` → `compound-docs`** - Renamed the skill to match the new command name.

### Updated

- All documentation, philosophy sections, and references updated to use `/compound` and `compound-docs`

## [2.6.2] - 2025-11-27

### Improved

- **`/plan` command** - Added AskUserQuestion tool for post-generation options and year note (2025) for accurate date awareness.
- **Research agents** - Added year note (2025) to all 4 research agents (best-practices-researcher, framework-docs-researcher, git-history-analyzer, repo-research-analyst) for accurate date awareness when searching documentation.

## [2.6.1] - 2025-11-26

### Improved

- **`/plan` command** - Replaced vague "keep asking questions" ending with clear post-generation options menu. Users now see 4 explicit choices via AskUserQuestion: Start `/work`, Run `/plan_review`, Simplify, or Rework.

## [2.6.0] - 2024-11-26

### Removed

- **`feedback-codifier` agent** - Removed from workflow agents. Agent count reduced from 24 to 23.

## [2.5.0] - 2024-11-25

### Added

- **`/report-bug` command** - New slash command for reporting bugs in the compound-engineering plugin. Provides a structured workflow that gathers bug information through guided questions, collects environment details automatically, and creates a GitHub issue in the EveryInc/every-marketplace repository. Designed to be user-friendly for anyone using the plugin.

## [2.4.1] - 2024-11-24

### Improved

- **design-iterator agent** - Added focused screenshot guidance: always capture only the target element/area instead of full page screenshots. Includes browser_resize recommendations, element-targeted screenshot workflow using browser_snapshot refs, and explicit instruction to never use fullPage mode. Also added step to load relevant design skills (e.g., Swiss design) before starting iterations.

## [2.4.0] - 2024-11-24

### Fixed

- **MCP Configuration** - Moved MCP servers back to `plugin.json` following working examples from anthropics/life-sciences plugins. Removed `.mcp.json` file as it's not the correct approach.
- **Context7 URL** - Updated to use HTTP type with correct endpoint URL.

## [2.3.0] - 2024-11-24

### Changed

- **MCP Configuration** - Moved MCP servers from inline `plugin.json` to separate `.mcp.json` file per Claude Code best practices for plugin MCP integration.

## [2.2.0] - 2024-11-24

### Added

- **Context7 MCP Server** - Bundled Context7 for instant framework documentation lookup. Provides up-to-date docs for Rails, React, Next.js, and 100+ other frameworks.

## [2.1.0] - 2024-11-24

### Added

- **Playwright MCP Server** - Bundled `@playwright/mcp` for browser automation across all projects using this plugin. Provides screenshot, navigation, click, fill, and evaluate tools.

### Changed

- Replaced all Puppeteer references with Playwright across agents and commands:
  - `bug-reproduction-validator` agent
  - `design-iterator` agent
  - `design-implementation-reviewer` agent
  - `figma-design-sync` agent
  - `generate_command` command

## [2.0.2] - 2024-11-24

### Changed

- `design-iterator` agent - Updated description to emphasize proactive usage when design work isn't coming together on first attempt. Added examples showing how to suggest 5x or 10x iterations when initial changes don't fully resolve design issues.

## [2.0.1] - 2024-11-24

### Added

- `CLAUDE.md` - Project instructions with versioning requirements and pre-commit checklist
- `docs/solutions/plugin-versioning-requirements.md` - Detailed workflow documentation for maintaining version, CHANGELOG, and README in sync
