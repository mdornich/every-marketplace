# /codify is deprecated

**This command has been renamed to `/compound`.**

The new name better reflects the compounding engineering philosophy: each documented solution compounds your team's knowledge.

Tell the user: "Note: `/codify` has been renamed to `/compound`. Please use `/compound` going forward."

Now run the `/compound` command with the same arguments: #$ARGUMENTS
